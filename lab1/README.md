# Restaurant bill
Create a program that computes the restaurant bill. The program should ask the user for the meal's cost and the tip percentage.

## Goal:
* Write C++ programs
* Compile C++ programs
* Implement programs that use `std::cin` and `std::cout` correctly
* Implement mathematical expressions in C++
* Implement code that formats floating-point output correctly

Assume that the tax is 7.5% of the meal cost. Specifically, please use the value 0.075 to avoid issues with the unit test. This value should be defined as a constant in your program. And the tip is computed by multiplying the tip percentage from the user by the meal cost. Display the meal cost, tax, tip, and total amount.

Follow the sample output below as closely as possible. Note that <b>bold</b> values in the sample represent input by the user. Take note that different user input results in a different output.

<pre>
Please input meal cost: <b>34</b>
Please input tip percentage: <b>15</b>

Restaurant Bill
====================
Subtotal: $34.00
Taxes: $2.55
Tip: $5.10
====================
Total: $41.65

This program demonstrates fundamental concepts in C++ programming, including user input handling, mathematical calculations, and formatted output, essential for developing more complex applications.
