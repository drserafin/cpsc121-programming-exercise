# Military to Regular Time
Create a function called `MilitaryToRegularTime` that converts time in the military time format into the regular format.
For example, convert `2249` to `10:49 pm`. For simplicity, we will not require you to handle invalid input - but you are 
free to define how your program should respond to invalid user input.

The function should receive a single `int` parameter that represents the military time.
It should return a `std::string` that contains the regular time counterpart of the given military time.

Please see the sample output below to guide the design of your program.


## Sample output:
<pre>
Please enter the time in military time: <b>1433</b>
The equivalent regular time is: 2:33 pm
</pre>

<pre>
Please enter the time in military time: <b>0300</b>
The equivalent regular time is: 3:00 am
</pre>
